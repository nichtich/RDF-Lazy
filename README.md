**RDF::Lazy** is a Perl module, build on top of [RDF::Trine], to simplify use of
RDF data. The module is managed [at GitHub](https://github.com/nichtich/RDF-Lazy).

See also the similar PHP library [Graphite] that was developed independently by
Christopher Gutteridge (also [https://github.com/cgutteridge/Graphite](at GitHub))
and [ported to Python](http://code.google.com/p/python-graphite/) by Ronan Klyne.
